# Use this file to easily define all of your cron jobs.
#
# It's helpful, but not entirely necessary to understand cron before proceeding.
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

# Example:
#
set :output, "./config/cron_log.log"
#
# every 2.hours do
#   command "/usr/bin/some_great_command"
#   runner "MyModel.some_method"
#   rake "some:great:rake:task"
# end
#
# every 4.days do
#   runner "AnotherModel.prune_old_records"
# end

#every 1.days, :at => (DateTime.now.to_time + 1.minute).strftime("%H:%M%P") do
#  runner "Log.write"
#end

every 1.day, :at => '14:17pm' do
  runner "Connection.up_connection_on_time_out"
end

every 1.day, :at => '14:15pm' do
  runner "Connection.up_connection_on_time_out"
end
